    <h1>Rollerblading in Miami, Florida</h1>
    <p>
        Rollerblading is a great form of exercise that by definition involves getting out of the house.
        Once bladers learn to stay upright the sport is one the healthiest in Miami’s eternal battle of 
        the bulge; fewer repetitive strain injuries are likely than when jogging or participating in 
        racquet sports, and there is far less chance of drowning or shark attack than surfing. Gliding 
        along through the empty concrete canyons of Miami’s after-dark business district, or past the 
        admiring tourists thronging Miami Beach, it can seem too good to be true that calories are also 
        melting away.
